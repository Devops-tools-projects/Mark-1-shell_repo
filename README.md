# My first project
AWS monitoring code using shell scripting

we are first going to connect to the aws from our console using
"aws configure"

Post providing the "access key" and "password". we will execute the scrips used for listing all the detils like s3,ec2,Lambda,IAM users

we can add this script to cron to get details daily.

# Sort script

To sort the proper phone number from teh file.txt in single line command

we have used grep command, along with -e to include multiple regex

"[0-9]\{3\}" represents 3 numbers (\{3\}) between the range 0-9

^ is start of string. $ indicates end of the string.

\ to supress the specialness of the character.
